AI Assistant helps visitors to your website, narrow down which of the offered products or services suits their needs.

This is a minimal API for the assistant. It provides an endpoint for generating response based on visitor's input.

## Overview

Websites usually have sections that contain information about the various products or services offered by the website. 

It may contain a list of the different products or services offered, along with descriptions and more information in other pages.

This AI Assistant can help visitors narrow down which of the website's products or services suits their needs,

by classifying the **visitor's natural language input** into **one of the categories** of products or services offered by the website, 

You can then provide more information about that category.
